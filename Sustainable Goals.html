            17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were adopted by the United Nations in 2015 for setting 
            the agenda for 2030. They were created with the aim of "peace and prosperity for people and the
            planet...".They state that ending poverty and other deprivations, goes alongside strategies that
            improve health and education, reduce inequality, and increase economic growth - while tackling
            climate change and working to preserve oceans and forests. The SDGs emphasize the interconnected
            environmental, social and economic aspects of sustainable development by putting sustainability
            at their center

           and encourage sustainable practices throughout the entire lifecycle of products. This goal 
           emphasizes the importance of addressing unsustainable consumption and production patterns, which 
           are critical for achieving sustainable development globally.
