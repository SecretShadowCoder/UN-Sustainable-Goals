    In a world where resources are finite and dear 
    <br>
    SDG Twelve beckons, loud and clear 
    <br>
    With each passing day, the need grows strong 
    <br>
    To cherish our planet, where we all belong 
<br><br>
    In the bustling cities and the fields so green 
    <br>
    SDG Twelve's message must be seen 
    <br>
    To consume with awareness, to waste not a bit
    <br>
    For a sustainable future, we all must commit 
<br><br>
    Innovation and technology, let them lead the way 
    <br>
    Towards greener practices, come what may 
    <br>
    From renewable energy to recycling schemes 
    <br>
    SDG Twelve inspires our sustainable dreams 
<br><br>
    In the choices we make, in the products we buy 
    <br>
    Let's consider the impact, let's give it a try 
    <br>
    For the Earth's well-being, for generations to come 
    <br>
    SDG Twelve urges us to act, not just be numb 
<br><br>
    So let's join hands, let's stand as one 
    <br>
    For the sake of our planet, till the battle is won 
    <br>
    With SDG Twelve as our guiding star 
    <br>
    A brighter, greener future isn't far
